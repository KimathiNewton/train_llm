## THe process of Training LLM
The general process of creating an LLM includes pretraining and fine-tuning. The
“pre” in “pretraining” refers to the initial phase where a model like an LLM is trained
on a large, diverse dataset to develop a broad understanding of language. This pretrained model then serves as a foundational resource that can be further refined
through fine-tuning, a process where the model is specifically trained on a narrower
dataset that is more specific to particular tasks or domains. This two-stage training
approach consisting of pretraining and fine-tuning is depicted
